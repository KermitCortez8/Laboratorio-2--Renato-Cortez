# Expo Router and shadcn

Use [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) with [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) styling on web (Shadcn does not support native).

This template uses Postcss, autoprefixer, and tailwindcss to style the web version of the app. The project is configured to use a root `/src` directory for all source files.

New shadcn components can be added [according to the docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/accordion), i.e. by running the CLI: `npx shadcn@latest add accordion`

npx create-expo-app -e with-shadcn
